This is a personal project: Socket programming. This code will receive JSON data from Ruby on Rails DB through TCP. Then, it will send to the client IP through UDP. This may expand the functionality that transfers data to different platforms.

For a test, the client needs to run the following command in the terminal in order to receive a packet from the server:
$ nc -u 192.168.x.x 4321  #Your IP address

The client-side also may be available by UDPSocket.receive methods. (in work)
