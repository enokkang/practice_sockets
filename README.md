This is a personal project: Socket programming. This code will receive JSON data from Ruby on Rails DB through TCP. Then, it will send to the client IP through UDP. This may expand the functionality that transfers data to different platforms.

The client needs to run to receive a packet from the server:
$ nc -u 192.168.x.x 4321  #Your IP address
